# Postgres Environment

This is useful for development and production.

To use, clone the repository, and simply run:

`docker-compose up`

It will create all tables automatically and you will have a database running on `127.0.0.1:5432`. :)

If you want to ensure it is properly reset: `docker-compose up --build`
